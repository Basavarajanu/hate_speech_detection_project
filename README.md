<h1>Hate Speech Detection Project</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository contains code and resources for a Hate Speech Detection project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify text as hate speech or non-hate speech. Hate speech detection is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) and is aimed at promoting healthier online conversations and reducing toxicity.

Dataset
We have used dataset for training and evaluation. This dataset consists of samples annotated with hate speech labels. It includes text data from various sources such as social media platforms and forums.

Methodology
The project follows these major steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing text data, handling missing values, and converting text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

Model Development: Experimenting with different machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., SVM, LSTM, BERT) to find the best-performing model for hate speech detection.

Evaluation: Evaluating models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Also, analyzing the models' performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
